I took about two weeks to complete this project.

I had a lot of trouble with programming, since I am not experienced in this. I managed to solve most problems looking through Udacity's forum and I believe I found simple ways to solve issues with the key and door scripts, positioning the CoinPoof and the sounds associated with the door (open and closed).

In this project I tried to create a dark mood, using also a esotheric soundtrack.

I built this app in Android.
